				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>HTML markup consists of opening tags, closing tags, and contents. All of that combines into an "element." Here is a link to a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">video</a> that discusses this in more detail.</p>

				<p class="takeaway-title"> 5 most important take-aways from Lesson 1</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<ol>
						<li>What a web page is: A web page is a text document written in a language known as HTML. Our web browsers then read, interpret, and display these documents.</li>
						<li>How coding works: Coding involves writing text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer then follows the instructions written by the programmer.</li>
						<li>Programmers must write their code using the proper syntax, otherwise the computer will not be able to understand it.</li>
						<li>Programmers can’t remember everything: There are too many details and variations to keep everything in your head. It's more important to understand the broad strokes. You can actually google lots of specific things rather than trying to memorize them.</li>
						<li>Basic HTML vocabulary: A <b>tag</b> is contained within angled brackets. Most tags have what are known as an opening tag and a closing tag. However, some tags do not need a closing tag. They're known as “<b>void</b>” tags. An HTML <b>element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. An <b>attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element.</li>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson2-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">How do websites work?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description"> 
					<p>- You can think of a website much like your house.</p>
					<p>- <b>HTML</b> files are the <b>structure</b>. Where your wall is placed. What room is your living room, what room is your kitchen, etc.</p>
					<p>- <b>CSS</b> files are the <b>style</b>. What color is your carpeting? What decorations do you have up? What color is the wall?</p>
					<p>- <b>Javascript</b> files are your <b>interactive</b> components. Your garage door opener or your television remote. They’re changing some element of your house</p>
				</div>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson2-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Everything is a Box!</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Everything on a web page is actually a box. It gets changed using style. When you start to accept that everything is a box, you can begin to visualize this to move items around on the page.Always sketch out the boxes to better understand how the web page is structured. Start with the big boxes and work backward from there. Even really accomplished programmers do this :)
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson2-3">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Boxes within boxes within boxes...</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>HTML uses what some refer to as a "tree-like structure" for its documents. That is to say that elements can be placed inside other elements. Tree-like structures are used in a variety of disciplines to bring some sort of hierarchy to things. When you view an HTML page in a web browser, this tree-like structure manifests itself as a bunch of "nested" boxes. For a better visual example, take a look at this <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/cd/a4/30cda4a8b3dbbd18dafefd94573176d2.jpg">work of art</a>, in which Bob Ross is painting a picture of Rick Ross, who is painting a picture of Ross from <em>Friends</em>, who is painting a picture of Bob Ross and so on and so forth.</p>
					<p>When viewing actual HTML code, you can get a sense of this tree-like structure by keeping an eye out for all of the indents on the left side of the screen. The more indented an element is, the more nested it is.</p>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson3-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Avoiding Repetition</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>When we talk about avoiding repetition, we're talking about not having to manually rewrite code over and over and over again. This is important because it helps us avoid errors and make changes to our document more efficiently.</p>
					<p>It's pretty easy to overlook something. So, if we decide to make a change to our code, it's easy to  forget to make that change in every location that the repeated code appears.</p>
					<p>We're also able to save time by not manually rewriting code. Just like Andy, I want each "lesson" on this page to have the same style. Rather than manually apply that style to each lesson, I can give each lesson "div" the same "class" then apply one style to that class. The style will then show up for each lesson.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson3-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">The Wonders of CSS</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Cascading Style Sheets, more commonly known as CSS, allow us to make changes to the style of HTML elements. CSS enables us to control things like font size, color, background color, borders, margins, and much more. When we want to apply the same style to a bunch of related elements, we can give those elements a "class" and then apply style to that class.</p>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson4-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What is Computer Science?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Computer Science is about solving problems by breaking them down into smaller pieces and then providing a detailed sequence of steps that could be used to solve each piece. Those steps can then be executed by a computer!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson4-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Computers vs. Most Machines</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Most machines can only do one thing, or maybe just a few things. A toaster, for example, can toast stuff. That's basically it. However, a <b>computer</b> can do anything. It is a universal machine that we can program to do anything.</p>
					<p>To program a computer to do something, we must provide it with a <em>precise sequence of steps</em> that it can follow. A computer by itself can't do anything. It has a small group of functions that it can execute. It's up to us to provide it with the exact steps we want it to take, if we want it to do anything cool.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson4-3">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Programming Lanuages</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>A programming language refers to what we will use to tell a computer what to do. What we'll be using is a language called <b>Python</b>. Python is actually known as an interpreter. This means that when we write a program in Python, it interprets what we wrote and then runs the program in a way that the computer can understand.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson4-4">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Grammar</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Just like any language, programming languages have a specific <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nelly_country.jpg">grammar</a> to them. Whereas in English, I could write with incorrect grammar and you'd still probably understand what I'm saying, this is not the case with computers. Computers need us to write programs with exactly correct grammar, otherwise they can't do the cool things we want them to. This is that whole <b>technological empathy</b> thing we keep hearing about.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson4-5">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Python Expressions</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Python expressions follow specific grammatical rules. Although they can begin at a high level as a combination of non-terminals, we must get more granular until each piece of the expression is a terminal.</p>
					<p>For example: An Expression can be formed by combining an Expression with an Operator followed by an Expression. However, before it can be a legal Python statement, you need to break it down into a combination of terminals such as 1 + 1.</p>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson5-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What is a variable?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description"> 
					<p>A variable allows programmers to give names to values. We can then manipulate those variables to produce different values.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson5-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What does it mean to assign a value to a variable?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Let's say we have a variable called <b>Jimmy_Variable</b>. If we then write the following code:</p>
					<p>Variable = 33</p>
					<p>Now whenever we write Variable, it will actually refer to the value "33"</p>
				</div>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson5-3">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What is the difference between what the "=" means in math versus in programming.</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>The equal sign does not mean equal. It really is like an arrow. It means "Assignment." Put whatever the right side evaluates to into the name on the left side.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson5-4">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Why would variables be useful?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Variables are useful for a number of reasons. First of all, they can make code more readable by letting us use names that make sense to humans. Additionally, they allow us to store the value of important data. They also make it easier for us to make changes to values.</p>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson6-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What is a function?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>A function has 3 pieces:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>An input</li>
						<li>Some set of things that get done to that input</li>
						<li>An output</li>
					</ol>
					<p>A function can best be exemplified by the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Gnomes_plan.png">underpants gnomes</a> and their quest to make profits off of stealing underpants. Their input was underpants. Their output was profit. However, they never defined what they needed to do to the underpants to make a profit. Similarly, a function only works if you define what you want done to the input to create an output.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson6-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What is the difference between <b>making</b> and <b>using</b> a function?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>You make a function by beginning with the word <span class="code">def</span> then typing the name of the function followed by the parameters of the function within parentheses. This is followed by the "body" of the function. In the body, you write what you actually want done to the input parameters. As an example, you may write something for a function called <span class="code">square</span>:
					</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						def square(x): 
						<br>
						<span class="indent">answer = x * x</span>
						<br>
						<span class="indent">return answer</span>
					</div>
					<p>When you're ready to use your function, you simply place a value in for the parameter and then bingo bango:</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						print square(8) 
						<br>
						>>> 64
					</div> 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson6-3">
				<p class="takeaway-title">How do do programmers use functions to avoid repetition?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Functions can be reused forever and ever. Although we haven't quite learned how to do it yet, we will eventually be able to use functions to recreate HTML code and not have to manually rewrite it each time.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson6-4">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What happens if a function doesn't have a return statement?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>If a function doesn't have a return statement, then the computer won't know what to produce. For example, if you do the following: </p>
					<div class="code-block">
						def square(x): 
						<br>
						<span class="indent">answer = x * x</span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						print square(4)

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson7-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">'If' Statements</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>'If' statements allow us to specify a range of possible actions to take on an input, which could then change the output. This is useful since it can enable us to make our code do something different based on some comparison that is made. It gives us a lot more flexibility and is a building block for creating more complex programs.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson7-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">'While' Loops</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>'While' Loops allow us to write code that does the same thing over and over. This is particularly useful for when you're dealing with a list or string containing many elements. Rather than have to write a ton of code to individually act upon elements, a 'while' loop will let you do the same thing to each element. This is particularly useful for automating this very web page.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson7-3">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Solving Problems</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Perhaps the biggest takeaway from Stage 2 is the general approach we have been taught tosolving problems. Solving a programming problem really requires you to break that bigger problem down into smaller, simpler problems. By doing so, you're able to take really complex ideas, and create code that solves them.</p>

			<h2 id= "lesson-8">Lesson 8: Object Oriented Programming</h2>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-1">
				<p class="takeaway-title">What is Object Oriented Programming?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Object oriented programming is a style of programming focused on how you organize your code and structure your data. It stands in contrast to other styles such as procedural programming, in which the focus is on writing code that gets you logically from Point A to Point B. Object oriented programming wants to focus on the “objects” we want to manipulate, rather than on the logic that is used to manipulate them.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-2">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Why is Object Oriented Programming useful (particularly in large programming projects)?</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>Object oriented programming is useful because it enables us to create code that can be used and re-used in a variety of situations and by a variety of people. Rather than simply writing code that gets us from Point A to Point B, we can create these little pieces of code that are more generalized. Using the idea of “abstraction” we can strip down the characteristics of Point A and Point B and create code that can just get us from one point to another. This could then be used anytime someone wants to get between two points. When dealing with really large programming projects, being able to reuse code is incredibly useful and time-saving.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-3">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Objects, Classes, and Instances</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>It’s kind of hard to define objects, classes, and instances independently of one another. You can sort of think of a class as a set of characteristics or attributes of things. A class isn’t a real thing itself, just descriptors of what a thing could be. It can include both data and methods. Any “things” that get made and possess those characteristics are objects. When you actually create an individual object with those characteristics, it is an instance of that class and becomes an object. I think. It’s sort of confusing.</p>
					<p>Here is an example that tries to explain the differences: Let’s say you want to create a “class” called Cars. Cars have certain characteristics that make them cars. They have 4 wheels, and at least 5 windows. They have a steering wheel, an engine, etc.  Anything possessing these characteristics would be an object of the class “Car”. When you actually go and build an object containing these characteristics, you create an instance of that class.</p>
					<p>Wikipedia tells me that an object is a particular instance of a class, which I think is what my long-winded example above shows.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-4">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Method</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>A method is a programmed procedure defined as part of a class and included in any object from that class. A class can have more than one method and those methods can be re-used in multiple objects.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-5">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Module</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>A module is a unit of software that is both portable and interoperable. This means that this unit of software can be used in a variety of systems and can function effectively with components of other systems. This is a particularly valuable characteristic of software used in creating large programs since you can break complex coding problems down into smaller, simpler pieces and then use and reuse them when appropriate</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-6">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Library</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>In programming, a library is a collection of precompiled sequences of code that can be called upon when writing a program. It allows you to reuse certain sequences quickly and easily rather than re-writing everything manually.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-7">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Class Variables</p>
				<div class="takeaway-description">
					<p>A class variable is a variable defined at the class level rather than at the instance level. Every instance of that class shares the class variable. However, there is only one copy of this class variable. Every object of the class shares this one copy. If a change is made to this copy of the class variable, that change is reflected in every object of the class.</p>

			<div class="takeaway" id="lesson8-8">
				<p class="takeaway-title">Method Overriding</p>

					<p>Object oriented programming is a great way to go about creating smaller pieces of code that can feed into each other and enable you to accomplish way more. For example, we can create objects that act as these little machines that pump out HTML without us having to write it all manually. Additionally, we can grab objects that others have made, plug them into our code, and have way cooler stuff with much less effort.</p>
